    <wb:sourceNote>Gender parity index for primary completion rate is the ratio of the female primary completion rate to the male primary completion rate. It is calculated by dividing the female value for the indicator by the male value for the indicator. A GPI equal to 1 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value less than 1 indicates disparity in favor of males and a value greater than 1 indicates disparity in favor of females. The primary completion rate indicator is also referred to as gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary. </wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:source id="12">Education Statistics</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>Gender parity index for expected gross primary graduation ratio is the ratio of female expected gross primary graduation rate to the male expected gross primary graduation rate. It is calculated by dividing the female value for the indicator by the male value for the indicator. A GPI equal to 1 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value less than 1 indicates disparity in favor of males and a value greater than 1 indicates disparity in favor of females.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Expected gross primary graduation ratio. Male is the total number of new male entrants to the first grade of primary in a given year, regardless of age, who are expected to graduate from the last grade of primary education, regardless of repetition, expressed as a percentage of the male population at the official graduation age from primary education in the same year. This indicator is calculated by multiplying the expected gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education by the probability of graduation at the last grade of primary. This indicator is calculated on the basis of the reconstructed cohort method.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>School life expectancy (years). Tertiary. Male is the total number of years of schooling which a child of a certain age can expect to receive in the future, assuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any particular age is equal to the current enrollment ratio for that age. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. The expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed because of repetition.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>School life expectancy net of repetition (years). Primary to lower secondary. Female is the number of years of schooling that a female child of a certain age can expect to receive in the future, excluding years spent repeating grades. The indicator reflects the overall level of development of an education system in terms of the average number of years of schooling without repetition that can be offered to the school-age population, including those who never enter school. It is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the given level of education, plus the number of pupils of unknown age in the given level of education divided by the school-age population for that level of education, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education, minus the number of repeaters in a given level of education divided by the school-age population for that level, multiplied by the duration of that level of education.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of human development. It measures the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices measuring achievements in each dimension. The HDI is the geometric mean of the three dimension indices and embodies imperfect substitutability across all HDI dimensions. It thus addresses one of the most serious criticisms of the linear aggregation formula, which allowed for perfect substitution across dimensions. Some substitutability is inherent in the definition of any index that increases with the values of its components.

    <wb:name>Combined polity score</wb:name>
    <wb:source id="11">Africa Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>The Combined Polity score is computed by subtracting the AUTOCRACY score (UPP.INS.AUTO.XQ) from the DEMOCRACY score (UPP.INS.DEMO.XQ); the resulting unified polity scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic). Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceOrganization>Authoritarian regime"" in Western political discourse is a pejorative term for some very diverse kinds of political systems whose common properties are a lack of regularized political competition and concern for political freedoms. The term Autocracy is used and defined operationally in terms of the presence of a distinctive set of political characteristics.  In mature form, autocracies sharply restrict or suppress competitive political participation. Their chief executives are chosen in a regularized process of selection within the political elite, and once in office they exercise power with few institutional constraints. Most modern autocracies also exercise a high degree of directiveness over social and economic activity, but we regard this as a function of political ideology and choice, not a defining property of autocracy. Social democracies also exercise relatively high degrees of directiveness. The Polity data producers prefer to leave open for empirical investigation the question of how Autocracy, Democracy, and directiveness (performance) have covaried over time. </wb:sourceOrganization>

This includes traditional battlefield fighting, guerrilla activities, and all kinds of bombardments of military units, cities, and villages, etc. The targets are usually the military itself and its installations or state institutions and state representatives, but there is often substantial collateral damage in the form of civilians being killed in crossfire, in indiscriminate bombings, etc. All deaths--military as well as civilian--incurred in such situations, are counted as battle-related deaths.</wb:sourceNote>
