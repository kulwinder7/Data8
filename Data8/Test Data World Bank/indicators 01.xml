    <wb:sourceNote>Thermal efficiency (%) in power supply:  This supply-side energy efficiency indicator measure the efficiency of thermal plants in converting primary energy sources—such as coal, gas, and oil—into electricity. They are calculated by dividing gross electricity production from electricity and cogeneration plants by total inputs of fuels into those plants. Whether market-based or privately owned, self-generating plants that do not export their power are included in the index assessment. In the case of cogeneration plants, fuel inputs are allocated between electricity and heat production in proportion to their shares of the annual output. </wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:name>Transmission and distribution losses (%)</wb:name>
    <wb:source id="35">Sustainable Energy for All</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>Transmission and distribution losses (%): Transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses measure power lost in the transmission of (high-voltage) electricity from power generators to distributors and in the distribution of (medium- and low-voltage) electricity from distributors to end-users. T&amp;D losses are represented as a percentage of gross electricity production. They include both technical and nontechnical (or commercial) losses. Included in the latter are unmetered, unbilled, and unpaid electricity, including theft, which could be significant in developing countries. Aggregate T&amp;D system indicators may be dominated by factors other than losses. The location of primary energy resources (such as hydro lakes and coal seams) and large loads (cities and industries) may be more significant factors in T&amp;D efficiency indicators than the losses or efficiency of the transmission system itself. Properly separating true losses (and hence the efficiency potential of transmission systems) from exogenous location and scale factors and nontechnical losses would require detailed studies of system-dynamic interactions and real operating requirements that are not practical for global tracking purposes.</wb:sourceNote>

GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Coordinating Agency (CA) or lead donor in the Local Education Group (LEG) coordinates and facilitates partners’ engagement with the Global Partnership for Education, thus serving as the communication link between the LEG and the Secretariat. The CA has a central role in facilitating the work of the LEG and is selected by this group. The LEG is the local structure of the Global Partnership for Education that bring together partners to develop high quality education strategies and programs. They are typically led by the Ministry of Education and include development partners and other education stakeholders such as national government and public entities, local and international civil society organizations (CSOs), CSO coalitions, teachers' and parents' organizations and private sector providers. The specific composition, title, and working arrangements of the LEG will vary from country to country. The LEG should be a collaborative forum for policy dialogue and for alignment and harmonization of technical and financial support to the education sector plan. It seeks to ensure that all parties are kept fully apprised of the progress and challenges in the sector, and it collates and disseminates information on domestic and external funding for the education sector.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Estimated international education aid reported on the government’s budget and expressed as a percentage of the disbursed education aid for the government sector. Government sector aid includes aid disbursed in the context of an agreement with administrations (ministries, departments, agencies or municipalities) authorized to receive revenue or undertake expenditures on behalf of central government. This is part of the 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Development Effectiveness in the Education Sector, an unprecedented picture of aid effectiveness in the education sector that can be used as the basis for in-country dialogue and debate going forward. This information looks at how education aid is delivered and managed by development partners and governments. </wb:sourceNote>
    <wb:sourceOrganization>This indicator is part of the 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Development Effectiveness in the Education Sector. Data was collected in 2011 by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) from Ministries of Education and development partners on selected Paris Declaration indicators, which were adapted for the education sector, and on other additional information. Three tools were used to collect this data: the Ministry of Education Questionnaire and the Donor questionnaire for quantitative data, and an Explanatory Note for qualitative data. The GPE Secretariat worked closely with Local Education Groups (LEGs ) to collect, process, produce, review and validate this information; and the Coordinating Agency or lead donor was tasked to coordinate the exercise with the LEG and to work with the Ministry of Education. Information refers to data from 2010.

    <wb:sourceOrganization>This indicator is part of the 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Development Effectiveness in the Education Sector. Data was collected in 2011 by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) from Ministries of Education and development partners on selected Paris Declaration indicators, which were adapted for the education sector, and on other additional information. Three tools were used to collect this data: the Ministry of Education Questionnaire and the Donor questionnaire for quantitative data, and an Explanatory Note for qualitative data. The GPE Secretariat worked closely with Local Education Groups (LEGs ) to collect, process, produce, review and validate this information; and the Coordinating Agency or lead donor was tasked to coordinate the exercise with the LEG and to work with the Ministry of Education. Information refers to data from 2010.

    <wb:sourceNote>International education aid using national public financial management (PFM) systems and expressed as a percentage of the disbursed education aid for the government sector. PFM systems include budge execution procedures, financial reporting procedures and auditing procedures. Donors use national budget execution procedures when the funds they provide are managed according to the national budgeting procedures established in the general legislation and implemented by government. The use of national financial reporting means that donors do not impose additional requirements on governments for financial reporting. The use of national auditing procedures means that donors rely on the audit opinions issued by the country's supreme audit institution and on the government's normal financial reports/statements. Government sector aid includes aid disbursed in the context of an agreement with administrations (ministries, departments, agencies or municipalities) authorized to receive revenue or undertake expenditures on behalf of central government.

    <wb:sourceNote>International education aid provided in the context of programme-based approaches (PBAs) and expressed as a percentage of the total disbursed education aid. This indicator is measured by the donors’ use of (general or sector) budget support and/or joint financing mechanisms such as pool funding mechanisms. PBA is a way of engaging in development co-operation based on the principles of coordinated support for a locally owned programme of development, such as a national education plan. Programme-based approaches share the following features: Leadership by the host country; a single comprehensive programme and budget framework; a formalized process for donor coordination and harmonization of donor procedures; efforts to increase the use of country systems.

    <wb:sourceNote>The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called ""international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.</wb:sourceNote>

The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.  Pesticide trade is the value of trade covering insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and others, as described by the Harmonised Coding System (HS) code 3808.  Differences between figures given for total exports and total imports at the world level may be due to several factors, e.g. the time lag between the dispatch of goods from exporting country and their arrival in the importing country; the use of different classification of the same product by different countries; or the fact that some countries supply data on general trade while others give data on special trade.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Pesticides refer to insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances which may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids or other pests in or on their bodies.  The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.  Pesticide trade is the value of trade covering insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and others, as described by the Harmonised Coding System (HS) code 3808.  Differences between figures given for total exports and total imports at the world level may be due to several factors, e.g. the time lag between the dispatch of goods from exporting country and their arrival in the importing country; the use of different classification of the same product by different countries; or the fact that some countries supply data on general trade while others give data on special trade.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:source id="2">World Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>Personal remittances comprise personal transfers and compensation of employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and nonresident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by nonresident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees.

    <wb:sourceNote>Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices. This item shows receipts by the reporting country. Data are in current U.S. dollars.</wb:sourceNote>
