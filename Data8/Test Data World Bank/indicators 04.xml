    <wb:sourceNote>Open Budget Index scores countries from zero to 100, based on a subset of 91 questions from the questionnaire. These questions focus on the public availability of eight key budget documents (with a particular emphasis on the Executive’s Budget Proposal), and on the information they contain. A score of 81-100 indicates that a given country provides extensive information in its budget documents, a score of 61-80 indicates significant information, 41-60 indicates some  information, 21-40 indicates minimal information, and zero-20 indicates scant or no information.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Distance to frontier score illustrates the distance of an economy to the "frontier," which represents the best performance observed on each Doing Business topic across all economies and years included since 2005. An economy's distance to frontier is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 the frontier. For example, a score of 75 in 2012 means an economy was 25 percentage points away from the frontier constructed from the best performances across all economies and across time. A score of 80 in 2013 would indicate the economy is improving.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:name>Closing a business, recovery rate (cents on the dollar)</wb:name>
    <wb:source id="11">Africa Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>The recovery rate is recorded as cents on the dollar recouped by creditors through the bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The calculation takes into account whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern as well as costs and the loss in value due to the time spent closing down. If the business keeps operating, no value is lost on the initial claim, set at 100 cents on the dollar. If it does not, the initial 100 cents on the dollar are reduced to 70 cents on the dollar. Then the official costs of the insolvency procedure are deducted (1 cent for each percentage of the initial value). Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is taken into account, including the loss of value due to depreciation of the hotel furniture. Consistent with international accounting practice, the depreciation rate for furniture is taken to be 20%. The furniture is assumed to account for a quarter of the total value of assets. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2006 lending rates from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics, supplemented with data from central banks.

    <wb:sourceNote>The number of procedures required for a business in the construction industry to build a standardized warehouse is recorded by this indicator. Steps may include: (1) submitting relevant documents and obtaining necessary clearances, licenses, permits, and certificates; (2) completing required notifications and receiving necessary inspections; (3) obtaining utility connections for electricity, water, sewerage, and phone services; and (4) registering the warehouse after its completion. Interactions between company employees are not counted as procedures.

These include costs for documents, administrative fees for customs clearance and technical control, customs broker fees, terminal handling charges and inland transport. The cost measure does not include tariffs or trade taxes. Only official costs are recorded. Several assumptions are made for the business surveyed: Has 60 or more employees; Is located in the country's most populous city; Is a private, limited liability company. It does not operate within an export processing zone or an industrial estate with special export or import privileges; Is domestically owned with no foreign ownership; Exports more than 10% of its sales. Assumptions about the traded goods: The traded product travels in a dry-cargo, 20-foot, full container load. The product: Is not hazardous nor does it include military items; Does not require refrigeration or any other special environment; Does not require any special phytosanitary or environmental safety standards other than accepted international standards.</wb:sourceNote>

Information comes from local insolvency practitioners, laws and regulations as well as public information on bankruptcy systems. The recovery rate for economies with “no practice” (i.e., fewer than 5 cases a year over the past 5 years) is 0.

    <wb:sourceNote>The number of procedures required for a business in the construction industry to build a standardized warehouse is recorded by this indicator. Steps may include: (1) submitting all relevant documents and obtaining all necessary clearances, licenses, permits, and certificates; (2) completing all required notifications and receiving all necessary inspections; (3) obtaining utility connections for electricity, water, sewerage, and phone services; and (4) registering the warehouse after its completion (if required for use as collateral or for transfer of warehouse). Interactions between company employees are not counted as procedures.

    <wb:sourceNote>The time (in calendar days) required to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary licenses and permits, completing required notifications and inspections, and obtaining utility connections—is measured by this indicator. Information is collected from experts in construction licensing—including architects, construction lawyers, construction firms, utility service providers, and public officials who deal with building regulations. If a procedure can be accelerated legally for an additional cost, the fastest procedure is chosen. To make the data comparable across economies, several assumptions about the business, the warehouse project, and the procedures are used.

    <wb:sourceNote>CRISIL Inclusix is a relative index that incorporates various forms of basic financial services into one single metric. CRISIL Inclusix is India’s first comprehensive measure of financial inclusion in the form of an index. It is a relative index that has a scale of 0 to 100, and combines three very critical parameters of basic banking services — branch penetration (BP), deposit penetration (DP), and credit penetration (CP) — together into one single metric. For each of these parameters, CRISIL evaluates financial inclusion at the national/ regional/ state/ district level vis-à-vis a defined ideal. A CRISIL Inclusix score of 100 indicates the ideal state for each of the national/ regional/ state/ district level vis-à-vis a defined ideal. A CRISIL Inclusix score of 100 indicates the ideal state for each of the three parameters.</wb:sourceNote>

The three main dimensions assessed here are the accountability of the executive to oversight institutions and of public employees for their performance, access of civil society to information on public affairs, and state capture by narrow vested interests.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>The Statistical Capacity Indicator (SCI) provides an overview of the statistical capacity of over 140 developing countries. It is based on a diagnostic framework developed with a view to assessing the capacity of national statistical systems and monitoring progress in statistical development over time. The framework has three dimensions: statistical methodology; source data; and periodicity and timeliness. For each dimension, a country is scored against specific criteria, using information available from the World Bank, IMF, UN, UNESCO, and WHO. A composite score for each dimension and an overall score combining all three dimensions are derived for each country on a scale of 0-100. A score of 100 indicates that the country meets all the criteria.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Access to an all-season road is measured as the proportion of rural people who live within 2 kilometers (typically equivalent to a 20-minute walk) of an all-season road. An all-season road is a road that is motorable all year by the prevailing means of rural transport (often a pick-up or a truck which does not have four-wheel-drive). Predictable interruptions of short duration during inclement weather (e.g. heavy rainfall) are acceptable, particularly on low volume roads. The preferred approach to measuring this indicator is by analysis of household surveys that include appropriate questions about access to transport.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index captures how well countries are connected to global shipping networks. It is computed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) based on five components of the maritime transport sector: number of ships, their container-carrying capacity, maximum vessel size, number of services, and number of companies that deploy container ships in a country's ports. For each component a country's value is divided by the maximum value of each component in 2004, the five components are averaged for each country, and the average is divided by the maximum average for 2004 and multiplied by 100. The index generates a value of 100 for the country with the highest average index in 2004. . The underlying data come from Containerisation International Online.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Military expenditures data from SIPRI are derived from the NATO definition, which includes all current and capital expenditures on the armed forces, including peacekeeping forces; defense ministries and other government agencies engaged in defense projects; paramilitary forces, if these are judged to be trained and equipped for military operations; and military space activities. Such expenditures include military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions of military personnel and social services for personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country). Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</wb:sourceNote>

The ratio of PPP conversion factor to market exchange rate is the result obtained by dividing the PPP conversion factor by the market exchange rate. The ratio, also referred to as the national price level, makes it possible to compare the cost of the bundle of goods that make up gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States. PPP conversion factors are based on the 2011 ICP round.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Exchange rate refers to the exchange rate determined by the Development Economics Group through the Atlas Method, which is an alternative rate used to smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates by a special method of conversion used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</wb:sourceNote>
