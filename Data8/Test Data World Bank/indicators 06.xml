    <wb:sourceNote>Country's national development strategy is linked to medium-term expenditure framework and reflected in annual budgets.  The degree to which governments take the lead in co-ordinating aid-funded activities is the subject of a specific commitment in the Paris Declaration.  It is also a variable that seems to be subject to significant changes over time. Another dimension of ownership is the degree to which countries have development strategies that are clear and well operationalised, so that development efforts are effective and there is a robust basis for the alignment of aid with country policies. This is based on the World Bank's Results-Based National Development Strategies: Assessment and Challenges Ahead Report.

    <wb:sourceNote>The concept of mutual accountability is an important innovation of the Paris Declaration.

The specific focus of the agreed indicator (Indicator 12) is on mutual accountability for the implementation of the Partnership Commitments included in the Declaration and any local agreements on enhancing aid effectiveness.

    <wb:sourceNote>Percentage female teachers. Pre-primary is the number of female teachers at the pre-primary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the pre-primary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.</wb:sourceNote>

All data reflect values representing 12 month period ending December 2007 which have been reconciled between reporting country and UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF, unless otherwise noted.  All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year. Every effort was made in cases of discrepancy across the three agencies to obtain approval from the country on a final indicator value.  </wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>International migrant stock is the number of people born in a country other than that in which they live. It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:source id="2">World Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>The depth of the food deficit indicates how many calories would be needed to lift the undernourished from their status, everything else being constant. The average intensity of food deprivation of the undernourished, estimated as the difference between the average dietary energy requirement and the average dietary energy consumption of the undernourished population (food-deprived), is multiplied by the number of undernourished to provide an estimate of the total food deficit in the country, which is then normalized by the total population.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:source id="11">Africa Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>Depth of hunger or the intensity of food deprivation, indicates how much food-deprived people fall short of minimum food needs in terms of dietary energy. The food deficit, in kilocalories per person per day, is measured by comparing the average amount of dietary energy that undernourished people get from the foods they eat with the minimum amount of dietary energy they need to maintain body weight and undertake light activity. The depth of hunger is low when it is less than 200 kilocalories per person per day, and high when it is higher than 300 kilocalories per person per day.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:name>International tourism, number of arrivals</wb:name>
    <wb:source id="2">World Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>International inbound tourists (overnight visitors) are the number of tourists who travel to a country other than that in which they have their usual residence, but outside their usual environment, for a period not exceeding 12 months and whose main purpose in visiting is other than an activity remunerated from within the country visited. When data on number of tourists are not available, the number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members, is shown instead. Sources and collection methods for arrivals differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police, immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in hotels. Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries. The data on inbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals, not to the number of people traveling. Thus a person who makes several trips to a country during a given period is counted each time as a new arrival.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>This indicator reflects the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index measure of the degree of import concentration within a country.  The sectoral Hirschmann index is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared shares of exports of each industry in total exports for the region under study.  Takes a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that only a single product is exported.  Higher values indicate that imports are concentrated in fewer sectors.  On the contrary, values closer to 0 reflect a more equal distribution of market shares among importers.  Note that this type of concentration indicator tends to be quite vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations in relative-prices, in a way that commodity price rises make commodity importers look more concentrated.  </wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>The diversification index signals whether the structure of imports by product of a given country or group of countries differ from the structure of product of the world.  Diversification index that ranges from 0 to 1 reveals the extent of the differences between the structure of trade of the country or country group and the world average. The index value closer to 1 indicates a bigger difference from the world average. It is constructed as the inverse of a Herfindahl index, using disaggregated exports at 4 digits (following the STIC3).  This index is a modified Finger-Kreinin measure of similarity in trade. For more information, please consult the article of Finger, J. M. and M. E. Kreinin (1979), “A measure of ‘export similarity’ and its possible uses” in the Economic Journal , 89: 905-12.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:source id="11">Africa Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>This indicator measures the extent of General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) commitments for all 155 services sub-sectors as classified by the GATS and in the four modes of the GATS. Each entry in the country’s schedule is assigned scores based on its relative restrictiveness, using a criteria set out by Bernard Hoekman’s methodology.  That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. </wb:sourceNote>

Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the import volume indexes (lines 73) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:sourceNote>It is the average tariffs imposed by developed countries on subsets of selected items (agricultural products, textile and clothing exports) that are deemed to be of interest to developing countries. For the purpose of calculating this indicator, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in North America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the EU (25 countries included since 2004) in Europe are considered “developed” regions or areas, following the common accepted practice used for MDG indicators. Developing countries are those not listed as developed or transition countries. The list of least developed countries (LDCs) has been agreed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Committee for Development Policy, Economic and Social Council. Agricultural, clothing and textile groups follow the definition in WTO agreements based on the Harmonized System 1992, transposed to current versions by WTO Secretariat. Agricultural products correspond to Harmonized System 1992, chapters 01 to 24 less fish and fish products (chap. 03); in addition to parts of chapters 29, 33, 35, 38, 41, 43, 50 to 53. Textile is mainly covered in chapters 50 to 60. The bulk of clothing products are found in chapters 61-63.

    <wb:sourceNote>Net barter terms of trade index is calculated as the percentage ratio of the export unit value indexes to the import unit value indexes, measured relative to the base year 2000. Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights.</wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:name>Export product concentration index</wb:name>
    <wb:source id="11">Africa Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>This indicator reflects the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index measure of the degree of export concentration within a country.  The sectoral Hirschmann index is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared shares of exports of each industry in total exports for the region under study.  Takes a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that only a single product is exported.  Higher values indicate that exports are concentrated in fewer sectors.  On the contrary, values closer to 0 reflect a more equal distribution of market shares among exporters. Note that this type of concentration indicator tends to be quite vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations in relative-prices, in a way that commodity price rises make commodity exporters look more concentrated.  </wb:sourceNote>

    <wb:source id="11">Africa Development Indicators</wb:source>
    <wb:sourceNote>The diversification index signals whether the structure of exports by product of a given country or group of countries differ from the structure of product of the world.  Diversification index is computed by measuring absolute deviation of the country share from world structure.  Diversification index that ranges from 0 to 1 reveals the extent of the differences between the structure of trade of the country or country group and the world average. The index value closer to 1 indicates a bigger difference from the world average. It is constructed as the inverse of a Herfindahl index, using disaggregated exports at 4 digits (following the STIC3).  </wb:sourceNote>
